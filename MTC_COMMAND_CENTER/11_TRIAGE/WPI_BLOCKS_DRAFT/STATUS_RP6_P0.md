# RP6-P0 — status: REPAIRED-PENDING-AUDIT, do not treat as accepted

Updated by the Codex implementer on 2026-08-10 under owner amendment A2/A2a. The
repair and its local falsification evidence are ready for independent Lead review;
the block is not frozen, accepted, dispatchable, or authorised for host execution.

- **F1 — REPAIRED BY HONEST DISCLOSURE.** The false fixed child count was removed.
  The header and terminal evidence now state the mixed environment, PATH-resolution,
  inherited-cwd and inherited-or-unset-TMPDIR surface, and explicitly do not claim
  round-1.4 probe-execution-environment binding. Full binding needs new preregistered
  inputs and is outside this bounded repair.
- **F2 — CLOSED BY LEAD ADJUDICATION; NO BLOCK CHANGE.** The existing STOP polarity
  remains correct under draft round 1.4's numeric-identity rows.
- **F3 — REPAIRED BY EXPLICIT RESIDUAL DISCLOSURE.** The terminal evidence now says
  P0 does not establish interpreter intermediate-component or symlink-target binding.
  Learning a target at runtime would violate row 18; accepting one requires a future
  preregistered target chain.
- **F4 — REPAIRED.** `:?` fail-closed backstops now follow the rc-3 pre-checks for
  `P0_EXPECT_UID`, `P0_FORBIDDEN_GIDS`, and `P0_VENV_ROOT`.

`SELF_QA_RP6.md` records literal local commands and real RED/GREEN output. No host
was contacted; no ssh, network, backtest, deployment, or trading action was run.
